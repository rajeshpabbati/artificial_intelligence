    "1. Formulating Questions and Commands\n",
    "Be Specific and Clear: Ask detailed questions. For example, instead of \"How do I improve my code?\", ask, \"How can I optimize my Python data preprocessing script with pandas for a large dataset?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Break Down Complex Queries: Divide complex questions into simpler parts. For example, first ask about hyperparameter tuning, then about feature importance in Random Forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Follow-Up Questions: If the initial response isn’t clear, ask for more details. For instance, \"Can you elaborate on that point?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Contextual Conversations\n",
    "Provide Context Early: When starting a new topic, briefly summarize previous discussions. For example, \"We discussed MNIST earlier. Now, I need help with TensorFlow.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Consistent Terminology: Stick to the same terms throughout the conversation to avoid confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarize Previous Interactions: When resuming a conversation, recap key points. For example, \"Last time we talked about model evaluation. Let’s continue with ROC curves.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ethical Considerations\n",
    "Avoid Sensitive or Harmful Content: Don’t share personal info or ask about harmful topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Responsibly: Verify critical information from reliable sources. Don’t rely solely on ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Promote Fairness and Inclusivity: Ensure queries are respectful and inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider Transparency: Disclose if ChatGPT was used in decision-making or content creation."
